# Summary

Herbaria are important resources for many aspects of botanical research. In recent years, many herbaria have been digitizing their collections, and placing all data and images online for anyone to access. In areas with limited internet access, it is necessary to save these collection data offline for later upload to an herbarium's database. 

Spindle is a user-friendly web app for herbarium data collection that can be used on- or offline. It uses many features of Angular2 to create a fillable web form that can export a CSV file for upload to an herbarium database.
