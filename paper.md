# Summary

Herbaria are important resources for many aspects of botanical research. In recent years herbaria have been digitizing their collections, and placing all data and images online for anyone to access. 

Spindle is a user-friendly web app for herbarium data collection. It uses many features of Angular2 to create a fillable web form that can export a CSV file for upload to an herbarium database.
