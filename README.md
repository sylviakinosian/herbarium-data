# Spindle: SPecimen INformation DAta capture & Label crEation

This app is designed to aid herbarium staff and botanical collectors with a way to record specimen data offline. Data is entered into a user-friendly web form, and then converted into a CSV file which can be sent to an herbarium database. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8. Our app runs via a web browser. We recommend using the latest version of Chrome (69+) or Firefox (62+).

## How does it work?

Open up [Spindle](http://spindle-herbarium.com/) in your web brower of choice. Enter information about the area in which you were collecting. Then click "Add collection" to add information for each collection you made. When finished, click the Verify & Export button to view your input and export as a CSV.

## Using Spindle offline

There are two ways to use Spindle offline. First, you can download a release to your computer [here](https://github.com/sylviakinosian/spindle/releases). Second, you can enable your browser to save a copy of spindle-herbarium.com: 

### Save website to your browser's cache

* Go to chrome://flags/#show-saved-copy
* Navigate to the "Show Saved Copy Button" option (should be at the top of the page)
* Using the drop down menu, select Enable: Primary
* Relaunch Chrome
* When you navigate to spindle-herbarium.com offline, the page will not load automatically. You will see a blue button towards the bottom that says "load saved copy." Click this and spindle-herbarium will load.
