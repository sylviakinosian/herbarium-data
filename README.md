# Spindle: SPecimen INformation DAta capture & Label crEation

This app is designed to aid herbarium staff and botanical collectors with a way to record specimen data offline. Data is entered into a user-friendly web form, and then converted into a CSV file which can be sent to an herbarium database. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8. Our app runs via a web browser. We recommend using the latest version of Chrome (69+) or Firefox (62+).

## How does it work?

Open up Spindle in your web brower of choice. Enter the area in which you were collecting ("Flora"). The add information for each collection you made. When finished, click the Verify & Export button to view your input and export as a CSV.
